    "Over the last years, **Machine Learning** tools have been successfully applied to problems in high-energy physics. For example, for the classification of physics objects. Supervised machine learning algorithms allow for significant improvements in classification problems by taking into account observable correlations and by learning the optimal selection from examples, e.g. from Monte Carlo simulations.\n",

    "# Importing the Libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "**Numpy** is a powerful library that makes working with python more efficient, so we will import it and use it as np in the code. **Pandas** is another useful library that is built on numpy and has two great objects *series* and *dataframework*. Pandas works great for *data ingestion* and also has *data visualization* features. From **Hipe4ml** we import **TreeHandler** and with the help of this function we will import our *Analysis Tree* to our notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Matplotlib** comes handy in plotting data while the machine learning is performed by **XGBOOST**. We will import data splitter from **Scikit-learn** as *train_test_split*. **Evaluation metrics** such as *confusion matrix*, *Receiver operating characteristic (ROC)*, and *Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC AUC)*  will be used to asses our models.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Confusion Matrix** $C$ is such that $C_{ij}$ is equal to the number of observations known to be in group $i$ and predicted to be in group $j$. Thus in binary classification, the count of true positives is $C_{00}$, false negatives $C_{01}$,false positives is $C_{10}$, and true neagtives is $C_{11}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $ y^{'}_{i} $ is the predicted value of the $ i$-th sample and $y_{i}$ is the corresponding true value, then the fraction of correct predictions over $ n_{samples}$ is defined as \n",
    "$$\n",
    "True \\: positives (y,y^{'}) =  \\sum_{i=1}^{n_{samples} } 1 (y^{'}_{i} = y_{i}=1)\n",

    "CBM has a modified version of the cern's root software and it contains the simulated setup of CBM. Normally, a model generated input file, for example a URQMD 12 AGeV, is passed through different macros. These macros represent the CBM setup and it is like taking particles and passing them through a detector. These particles are registered as hits in the setup. Then particles' tracks are reconstructed from these hits using cellular automaton and Kalman Filter mathematics.\n",
